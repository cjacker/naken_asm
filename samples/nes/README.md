Just a simple Nintendo NES test that creates a couple tiles and draws
them on the display.

Currently recommend running with the fceux emulator due to its debugging
features:

    fceux test.nes

To run with mame:

    mame nes -window -cart test.nes

To run with mame with the debugger:

    mame nes -window -debug -cart test.nes
